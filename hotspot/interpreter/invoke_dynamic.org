The feature's main goal was to create a bytecode to handle a new type of method dispatch - that essentially allows application-level code to determine which method a call will execute, and to do so only when the call is about to execute. 
The general idea is that each invokedynamic instruction is associated with a special method (known as a bootstrap method or BSM). When the invokedynamic instruction is reached by the interpreter, the BSM is called. It returns an object (a CallSite containing a MethodHandle) that indicates which method the call site should actually execute.
